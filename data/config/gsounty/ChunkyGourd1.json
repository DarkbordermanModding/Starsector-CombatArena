    "description":"A boxer in his youth, and a man who trained Wunder in 16 fighting styles.  Including the infamous Garnir Drunken-style.  Known for his tendency to pick a fight with anyone, as Wunder aged, he would have long talks with Freedom about his aggression and balanced and realigned his views.  Wunder turned freedom from a unruly and angry person, into someone who was fiercely dedicated to the protection of the Hegemony, and to his leader and Admiral.",
    "dialog":"If you're against the Hegemony, you're against me.  If you're against me, I pray to Ludd that you have a better arm.",
